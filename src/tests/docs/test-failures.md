# Test Failures Analysis

## Database RLS Tests

### Users Table RLS
- [ ] `should prevent users from updating other users profiles` (Criticality: 5)
  - Error: `expected null not to be null`
  - Analysis: RLS policy not preventing updates as expected
  - Fix needed: Review and fix user update policy in schema
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Initial RLS policy implementation with `auth.uid() = id`
    * Policy exists but not blocking updates as expected

### Channels Table RLS
- [ ] `should automatically add creator as owner` (Criticality: 5)
  - Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')`
  - Analysis: Channel creation failing, not returning data
  - Fix needed: Debug channel creation policy and owner trigger
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Basic channel creation with owner trigger
    * Verified trigger exists in schema

- [ ] `should prevent non-members from viewing private channels` (Criticality: 4)
  - Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')`
  - Analysis: Channel creation failing in test setup
  - Fix needed: Same as above, fix channel creation first
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Blocked by channel creation issue
    * RLS policy exists but untested due to creation failure

### Channel Members Table RLS
- [ ] `should allow owners to add members` (Criticality: 5)
  - Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')`
  - Analysis: Test channel not being created in beforeAll
  - Fix needed: Debug channel creation in test setup
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Blocked by channel creation issue
    * Owner role assignment trigger exists but untested

- [ ] `should prevent regular members from adding other members` (Criticality: 3)
  - Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')`
  - Analysis: Same as above
  - Fix needed: Fix channel creation first
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Blocked by channel creation issue
    * RLS policy exists but untested

### Messages Table RLS
- [ ] `should prevent non-members from posting messages` (Criticality: 4)
  - Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'id')`
  - Analysis: Private channel creation failing in setup
  - Fix needed: Fix channel creation issues
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Blocked by channel creation issue
    * Message posting policy exists but untested

- [ ] `should prevent users from modifying others messages` (Criticality: 5)
  - Error: `expected null not to be null`
  - Analysis: RLS policy not preventing message modifications
  - Fix needed: Review and fix message update policy
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Initial RLS policy implementation with sender_id check
    * Policy exists but not blocking updates as expected

### Reactions Table RLS
- [ ] `should prevent users from modifying others reactions` (Criticality: 2)
  - Error: `expected null not to be null`
  - Analysis: RLS policy not preventing reaction modifications
  - Fix needed: Review and fix reaction delete policy
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Basic RLS policy implementation
    * Policy exists but not blocking deletes as expected

- [ ] `prevents duplicate reactions` (Criticality: 1)
  - Error: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'message')`
  - Analysis: Error accessing error message, but underlying issue is unique constraint
  - Fix needed: Review unique constraint on reactions table
  - Attempted solutions:
    * Unique constraint defined in schema
    * Test error handling needs improvement

## Component Tests (Criticality: 2)
These are path resolution issues, not schema related:
- [ ] `auth-redirects.test.tsx`: Failed to load LoginForm component
- [ ] `LoginForm.test.tsx`: Failed to load UI button component
- [ ] `RegisterForm.test.tsx`: Failed to load UI button component
Attempted solutions:
  * None yet - low priority compared to database issues

## Root Causes

1. **Channel Creation Issues** (Criticality: 5)
   - Most failures stem from channel creation not working
   - This is blocking multiple test chains
   - Priority fix needed here first
   - Attempted solutions:
     * Basic channel creation policy
     * Owner trigger implementation
     * No debugging logs added yet

2. **RLS Policy Failures** (Criticality: 5)
   - User update policy not working
   - Message modification policy not working
   - Reaction modification policy not working
   - Attempted solutions:
     * Initial policy implementations
     * No policy debugging yet

3. **Constraint Issues** (Criticality: 1)
   - Reaction uniqueness constraint might not be properly enforced
   - Attempted solutions:
     * Basic constraint definition
     * No constraint debugging yet

## Next Steps (Prioritized by Criticality)

1. Fix channel creation first (Criticality 5):
   - Add error logging to channel creation tests
   - Debug channel insert policy
   - Verify owner trigger is working
   - Add transaction logging

2. Fix critical RLS policies (Criticality 5):
   - Debug and fix user update policy
   - Debug and fix message modification policy
   - Add policy violation logging

3. Fix member access controls (Criticality 4):
   - Test private channel visibility
   - Test message posting restrictions
   - Add access logging

4. Fix lower priority issues (Criticality 1-3):
   - Reaction policies
   - Constraint handling
   - Component path resolution
