## SpikyPOVs

### Truths
- Digital Twins are the future of workplace communication - AI should learn and adapt to each user's communication style
- AI features should be prominent and valuable, not just background enhancements
  - Smart message suggestions
  - Meeting notes generation
  - Context-aware responses
  - Sentiment analysis
- Real-time features must be implemented with optimistic updates to feel instant, even in poor network conditions
- Modern chat applications need to support rich media while maintaining strict performance standards:
  - Message delivery < 100ms
  - Search results < 200ms
  - 99.9% uptime
- Security and privacy are foundational requirements:
  - End-to-end encryption for DMs
  - GDPR compliance
  - Regular security audits
  - Proper rate limiting and quota management
- The platform must scale efficiently:
  - Support for 10k+ concurrent users
  - File upload support up to 100MB
  - Efficient message pagination
  - Optimized search functionality
- Accessibility is a core feature, not an afterthought:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  - Keyboard navigation
  - Screen reader support
  - High contrast mode

### Myths
- We don't believe AI should be subtle or hidden - it should be a visible, core feature that users actively engage with
- We don't believe in sacrificing features for simplicity - instead, we use smart UX design to make complex features accessible
- We don't believe in trading privacy for features:
  - All AI processing must be transparent
  - Users must have control over their data
  - Clear data retention policies
- We don't believe in limiting storage without clear quotas:
  - Attachments: 1GB per user
  - Avatars: 10MB per user
  - Clear quota management
- We don't believe in unrestricted API access:
  - Messages: 60/min create, 30/min update/delete
  - Channels: 10/min create/delete, 30/min update
  - Files: 30/min upload/delete
- We don't believe in treating mobile as second-class:
  - Mobile-first design
  - Cross-platform consistency
  - Responsive performance
