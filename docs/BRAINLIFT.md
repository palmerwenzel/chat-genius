- SpikyPOVs
  - Truths
    - Digital Twins remain the future of workplace communication – AI should learn and adapt to each user’s style, particularly through our newly introduced chatbots
    - AI features like chatbots and context-driven RAG should be front-and-center, offering on-demand, intelligent responses to user queries
      - Smart message suggestions
      - Meeting notes generation
      - Context-aware chatbot prompts
      - Sentiment analysis
      - Intelligent knowledge retrieval with RAG
    - Real-time features must be implemented with optimistic updates to feel instant, even in poor network conditions
    - Modern chat applications need to support rich media while maintaining strict performance standards:
      - Message delivery < 100ms
      - Search results < 200ms
      - 99.9% uptime
    - Security and privacy are foundational requirements:
      - End-to-end encryption for DMs
      - GDPR compliance
      - Regular security audits
      - Proper rate limiting and quota management
    - The platform must scale efficiently:
      - Support for 10k+ concurrent users
      - File upload support up to 100MB
      - Efficient message pagination
      - Optimized search functionality
    - Accessibility is a core feature, not an afterthought:
      - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
      - Keyboard navigation
      - Screen reader support
      - High contrast mode
  - Myths
    - We don’t believe AI should be hidden or reduced to a minor feature – it should be interactive and transparent, aiding user productivity in real time
    - We don’t believe in sacrificing advanced features for simplicity – instead, we use thoughtful UX design to make our chatbot and RAG features feel intuitive
    - We don’t believe in treating mobile as second-class:
      - Mobile-first design
      - Cross-platform consistency
      - Responsive performance
